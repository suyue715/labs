# Cross-Validation Lab

Your lab can be found in `cross_validation.ipynb`!

Notes:

1. Questions 5 and 6 are bonus questions -- if you have extra time please feel free to tackle them, otherwise, we will only expect completion through question 4.
2. Have fun, take it slow, and make sure that you understand which sets are your **training** sets and which are your **test** sets. It is better to stop and double check what you are doing to avoid confusion.
