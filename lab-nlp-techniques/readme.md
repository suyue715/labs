# Natural Language Processing Techniques Lab

In this lab, we'll get some practice with LDA and NLP using a set of tweets about airline companies and their performance.

**Note**: this lab has only a couple of prompts -- most of your time will not be spent in answering the questions but in refining and exploring your answers. There is also a bonus question in the LDA topic that is completely optional. It is worth spending the extra time here refining the techniques you use to get the best possible response (with NLP, often times doing the best feature extraction early on can reap great dividends!)
